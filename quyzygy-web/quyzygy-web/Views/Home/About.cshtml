                <p>
                    Quyzygy is a small project designed by five Computer Science students as a way of providing other students and teachers a way to take tests even if on the move.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Quyzygy allows teachers to create tests and share them with their students, while being able to see their progress in real time.
